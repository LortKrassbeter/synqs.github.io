abstract: In the fundamental laws of physics, gauge fields mediate the interaction
  between charged particles. An example is the quantum theory of electrons interacting
  with the electromagnetic field, based on U(1) gauge symmetry. Solving such gauge
  theories is in general a hard problem for classical computational techniques. Although
  quantum computers suggest a way forward, large-scale digital quantum devices for
  complex simulations are difficult to build. We propose a scalable analog quantum
  simulator of a U(1) gauge theory in one spatial dimension. Using interspecies spin-changing
  collisions in an atomic mixture, we achieve gauge-invariant interactions between
  matter and gauge fields with spin- and species-independent trapping potentials.
  We experimentally realize the elementary building block as a key step toward a platform
  for quantum simulations of continuous gauge theories.
