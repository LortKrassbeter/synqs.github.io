abstract: We augment the information extractable from a single absorption image
  of a spinor Bose-Einstein condensate by coupling to initially empty auxiliary
  hyperfine states. Performing unitary transformations in both the original and
  auxiliary hyperfine manifold enables the simultaneous measurement of multiple
  spin-1 observables. We apply this scheme to an elongated atomic cloud of 87Rb
  to simultaneously read out three orthogonal spin directions and with that
  directly access the spatial spin structure. The readout even allows the
  extraction of quantum correlations which we demonstrate by detecting
  spin-nematic squeezing without state tomography.
